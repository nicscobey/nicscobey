### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey there -- I'm Nic! I'm a software developer with a background in education, and health and human services, and it's my goal is to promote global justice and equity.

Outside work and coding, you might find me:
â€¢ walking my dog (Samwise),
â€¢ playing the piano,
â€¢ lifting weights,
â€¢ appreciating the outdoors (especially mountains!),
â€¢ reading a science fiction book,
â€¢ or aimlessly wandering the downtown of a new city (I call this "urban adventuring"!).
